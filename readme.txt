Log and view all WP HTTP requests

== Description ==

= Log and view all WP HTTP requests =

How long do [core / plugin / theme] update checks take to run? What data about my site is being sent out? What about all those ajax requests? The answers to these questions are just a few clicks away.

This plugin logs all WP_HTTP requests and displays them in a table listing for easy viewing. It also stores the runtime of each HTTP request.

= Available Hooks =
Customize the length (in days) before older log items are removed:

<pre>
add_filter( 'lhr_expiration_days', function( $days ) {
    return 7; // default = 1
});
</pre>

Don't log items from a specific hostname:

<pre>
add_filter( 'lhr_log_data', function( $data ) {
    if ( false !== strpos( $data['url'], 'wordpress.org' ) ) {
        return false;
    }
    return $data;
});
</pre>

In the above example, the `$data` array keys correspond to columns within the `lhr_log` database table.
